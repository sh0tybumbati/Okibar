# YouTube API Setup Guide

Your Okibar karaoke system is now ready to use YouTube's API for song searches! Currently, it's running in **fallback mode** using cached results only.

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Get a YouTube API Key
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Click "Enable APIs and Services"
4. Search for "YouTube Data API v3" and enable it
5. Go to "Credentials" â†’ "Create Credentials" â†’ "API Key"
6. Copy your new API key

### Step 2: Configure Your App
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` and replace `YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key:
   ```
   YOUTUBE_API_KEY=AIzaSyBxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```

3. Restart your server:
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

### Step 3: Verify Setup
You should see this message when the server starts:
```
âœ… YouTube API is ready for karaoke searches!
```

## ðŸ”’ Security Best Practices

1. **Restrict your API key** in Google Cloud Console:
   - Go to your API key settings
   - Under "Application restrictions", select "HTTP referrers" for web apps
   - Add your domain: `localhost:3000` for development
   - Under "API restrictions", select "YouTube Data API v3"

2. **Set usage quotas** to prevent unexpected charges:
   - YouTube Data API v3 has a daily quota
   - Monitor usage in Google Cloud Console

## ðŸŽµ How It Works

- **With API key**: Real-time YouTube search for karaoke videos
- **Without API key**: Uses cached songs from previous searches + demo results
- **API quota exceeded**: Automatically falls back to cached results
- **API errors**: Graceful fallback with user-friendly messages

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

- The system automatically adds "karaoke" to your search queries
- Results are filtered for music category and safe content
- Previously searched songs are cached locally for offline use
- API key is tested on server startup for immediate feedback

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### "YouTube API key is invalid"
- Double-check your API key in the `.env` file
- Ensure YouTube Data API v3 is enabled in Google Cloud Console
- Check that your API key hasn't expired or been regenerated

### "YouTube API quota exceeded"
- You've hit your daily usage limit
- The system will automatically use cached results
- Consider upgrading your quota in Google Cloud Console

### Still seeing demo results?
- Verify your `.env` file exists and has the correct API key
- Restart the server after making changes
- Check server console for error messages
